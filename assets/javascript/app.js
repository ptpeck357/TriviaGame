//After the "Start" button is clicked, show question with posibble answers while the timer is slowly decreasing

//If an answer is answered correct or incorrect, show screen saying either correct or incorrect and pause timer
//This is where you increment or deincrement the variables "Correct" or "Incorrect"

//Without user input, move onto the next question and resume the timer

//When time runs out for current question, say, "out of time"
//This is where you increment the variable "Unanwsered question"
//Without user input, moves onto the next question and restarts timer

//When the user gets through all of the questions, show "correct answers, incorrect answers and unanswered questions"
//Then say, startover?
